# Spotify UI Clone Lab

Submitted by: Gabriela Liera

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Summary

Spotify Clone is an android app that replicates the UI login of Spotify. The goal of this project is to create an app's UI using XML layout files and common components, use drawables to set a logo and set the colors using themes to represent the brand of an app.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ü§ìüß†üë©‚Äçüíª

## Notes

During this lab, I became familiar different views and coding xml files. I worked with textView, editText, buttons, and imageView. In addition, I faced some incompatible gradle issues and learn to upgrade, rebuild, and sync my gradle files with the project.
